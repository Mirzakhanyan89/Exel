# Exel
  This is an implementation of program that has quite a lot of similarities with the excel program. Here we have Cell and Spreadsheet classes. Spreadsheet class consists of a two-dimensional array of Cell type and two intager variables.
  You can add a new row, column or remove them in this program. Additionally we can swap rows and columns.
