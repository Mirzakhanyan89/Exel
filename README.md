# Exel
  There are implemented a program that has quite a lot of similarities with the excel program. Here we have Cell and Spreadsheet classes. Spreadsheet class consists of a two-dimensional array of Cell type and two int variables.
Functions are implemented in this class, through which we can add a new row and column to the cell we have, or, if possible, remove any row or column. We also have functions for changing rows and columns.
